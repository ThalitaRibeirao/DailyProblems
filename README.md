- **/Problems:** In this folder you can read each solution - the problems are numbered in the order of difficulty set by Beecrowd (1 being the easiest and so on).

## Running the Code
Since this repository is focused on problem-solving in the Visual Studio environment, you can run the code directly within Visual Studio. **Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and configurations set up to execute C# code.**
To run it, follow these steps:

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Locate the problem you want to review or solve
3. Change the problem number in the 'Problems.cs' file.

     Ex.:  *Problem9 x = new Problem9()* => *Problem3 x = new Problem3()* 
4. Navigate to the "Problems.cs" file and run it.
